# Marvel Comics API with React JS

Using Marvel's API to show information on characters of the Marvel Univers.  This API does require an API Key, to get an key sign up 
on [Marvel Developers Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/).

# Description
I am using Marvel's api to build a small app using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Its a simple form that serches and returns basick information about Marvel character (character Image, character Name, and short Description).  If left the branches, I didn't delete the development branches so that I can document the progress.  I plan on using a lot more features and seeing how robust I can build this app out. 

To view this app on a server you go over to [neveo.com/marvelcomics-api](http://www.neveo.com/marvelcomics-api) and enter in some of your favorite Marvel characters and see if you can learn a bit more.  

or

After you get your api key form the marvel site, download this repo, cd in the marvelcomics-api directory and run:
```bash
npm install
```
